# 📁 Samples

This folder contains sample files from projects created with **VisionBoard@1.0.0** and the **OpenJS Foundation: Security Compliance Guide v2.0**.

These samples let you explore and interact with real project data **without needing to set up the projects yourself or use your own GH tokens**. Keep in mind that some of the content may be outdated and might not reflect the current security postures of the original projects.
